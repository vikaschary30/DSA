// Stock span problem - Problem Statement : Given an array arr of size n, where each element arr[i] represents the stock price on day i. Calculate the span of stock prices for each day.The span Sáµ¢ for a specific day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive previous days (including the current day) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price on day i.
//                      1) brute force - TC:O(n^2) SC:O(N) For each day, count consecutive previous days (including today) with stock prices less than or equal to the current day's price.
